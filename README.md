# module12-employee-tracker-challenge

## Description

In this challenge, I created a content management system using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL. This application allows non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in a database. Basic features of the app include the ability to view a company's database by departments, roles, and employees. Some of the more advanced features include the ability to create, remove, and edit information in the database.
